Notes:
      The visualizations should take 5 min (the app + carlos piece)
      Everything else should take 5 min
      canva -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019/data 

To Do
      make 3-4 sentences about each visualization -> first should be longest, then getting shorter for next few

-----Intro----- Jackie
      Hello and welcome to our presentation, Spotify Data Visualizations. Our group studied trends in four music genres between 1998 and 2020, then created an interactive website to display our findings. Hello, I'm Jacqueline, (everyone introduces themselves)
      We chose this topic because music is an integral part of our society that reflects and influences culture. Our presentation is a small glimpse into some of the music trends that have occurred in the past two decades. 

-----Data Sources----- Jackie
      We used 'Top Hits Spotify from 2000-2019' from Kaggle for our analysis. This dataset has statistics of the top 2,000 tracks from between 1998 and 2020. It contains 18 columns that break down each track, such as song duration, tempo (aka beats per minute or bpm), and loudness (measured in decibles).

-----Project Goals----- Jackie
      To begin, our overall objective was to analyze the dataset for patterns and trends. What was the data saying by itself before we looked for specific metrics? Did anything stand out? We used the variables provided, such as speechiness, acousticness, energy, etcetera and grouped them by year and genre. 
      Our question was, how did the genres change over time, and what changed? Was it loudness? Energy? Danceability? Pop music from 2000 and 2020 are very distinct styles. While 'style' isn't measurable, factors like loudness and duration are, and can be analyzed over time. 
      We also were interested on the content of the songs and how they change through the years. Are song durations changing? What about songs being explicit? Between genres, which were explicit? Which had longer songs? 
      Our last goal was to create interactive visualizations to show off our findings.

-----Considerations and Limitations----- Madison
      The data, however, is imperfect and limitations should be acknowledged.
      For example, the data is limited in size. The dataset contains 2000 songs, which may not be representative of the entire Spotify catalog. Also, the data is not spread evenly across time. Generalizations should be made cautiously.
      The dataset also groups many genres together, and may not cover all genres or sub-genres, potentially limiting the diversity of the analysis. For example, differences between metal and pop rock are not accounted for, and are grouped together. 
      There also exists cultural shifts, as mentioned before, music changes over time as musical tastes and genres evolve. The analysis has to be mindful of cultural shifts and how they may impact characteristics of the songs over the years.
      Another factor to consider are qualitaive aspects  of a song's appeal, such as lyrics or cultural context. This could limit the depth of analysis because they are not numerical factors.
      Lastly, this dataset only lists 'top' songs, and might not capture individual user preferences or the influence of social networks on music choices. 





-----Data Process and Cleanup-----
      how create database, how set it up, how transform it, clean up,

-----Visualization 1----
genre -> average metric : change in metric over time for genre
The first interactive set of charts has users select genre and then a metric 
it shows each genre and metric over to track changes in the genre over time
music evolves and changes, what is 'pop' in the past is relative to its time -> show changes like duration
can track evolutions in music over the past two decades -> music branches into different genres, or different genres are popular
pop ->  a contemporary form of music that appeals to a very wide audience -> genre shifts from decade to decade 80s rock to 90s boybands 

-----Visualization 2----
interactive #2
genre : count of songs over time 
might reflect popularity of certain genres over time ->
